IDEA: Trick Toon into thinking it gets data from the internet, while it's actually coming from me!
And with that trick, use the new Hue support to actually control the PYH server with that! (scenes -> activities...)

--> That works and you can see the network packets of the Toon device. Unfortunately it's all HTTPS to a single server: 95.142.102.183

IP Lookup Result for 95.142.102.183 - 

IP Address:
95.142.102.183 

Host of this IP:
a3985.homeautomationeurope.atom86.net 

Organization:
Schuberg Philis B.V.

--> Indeed Schuberg Philis does IT business for Eneco

So no possibility to soft-hack the Toon with that network traffic (like wheather, etc)
Or maybe it's possible to fake an SSL connection with 95.142.102.183, but that probably requires a real signed certificate and maybe it actually checks
the expected certificate on the Toon device, etc. So no use there to go into that much trouble for a almost certain death path.
Although this still leaves open the option of soft-hacking Hue support, since that works on a local connection and only HTTP



Steps to set up the shared network: (Wireless connection 3 should still be there to re-enable)
