- Add nice favicon.ico file for PYH webapp
X move to jquery rest prod (min) version
X move to handlebars prod (runtime) version
- find out if we need all mmenu css and js stuff
X Figure out a nicer way to connect the click logic to the activities/lights/etc pages
- Refactor out local images (refreshable ones at least) and use all images from server
  - Serve module depenent images from the main server -> individual modules should not be required to provide context images for their functionality!
- Document specifics of used JS stuff on menu / pages / rest / etc
  - mmenu: href='#' will have default behavior blocked!
  - mmenu: explicitely setting offCanvas: true will trigger a menu sliding bug!
  - mmenu: Custom change in the colors of the dark theme
  - rest: double nested resources requires ID for the first!
    So my REST service starts at /main /hue etc, which makes sense indeed, sep rest services for these URL's
    furthermore, the rest plugin really forces using the REST api, so get ready to reastify :)
	(probably fine to support both full rest and getters along the way. (or just use rest where I can use it and
	use simple wget style stuff to activate activities / press buttons etc)
  - Design choices: changes in the list of lights, devices, activities etc are NOT auto-refreshable! You need to reboot the app to load those changes.
    Nice add-on: detect the changes and provide message with button to reboot.
- Unit test your javascript code!
