  - Or probably better: use a separate impl parent pom, because the api modules shouldn't have any dependencies
- Spring wiring: seperate project that uses maven dependecies to include the actual impl's for the api's instead of in the server pom itself!?!
- Event bus next to api's or even only event bus?
