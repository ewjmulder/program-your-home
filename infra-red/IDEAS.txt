Actually, WinLIRC data should always be checken on conf files in classpath and it should fail if there is no match.
Or future: If WinLIRC is not running yet / not having the right config: provide functionality to (auto) stop/start it and
update it's configuration according to the conf files on the classpath (or config path)
