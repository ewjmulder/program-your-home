Issues in provisioning:
- PcInstructor doesn't work on headless java -> should be a separate running module.
  - This obviously needs refactoring!
- Why is event store taking 20% CPU?
  - Weird, changed 0.0.0.0 to 192.168.2.37
  - TODO: Test with some different settings, most notably projections on/off
  - TODO: Ask on some kind of forum, these guys seem to be eager to help
- product-stock.js needs /r/n because Event Store is a Windows based product
  - file already is PC style, probably curl changes that. possible solution: --data-binary in curl POST -> mistaken reorder at first
  - --data should have been --data-binary, fixed now and works!
- remotes config not in /etc/lirc/lircd.conf
  - Tried a symlinc from /etc/lirc/lircd.conf.d/ to remotes in pyh repo -> nope, not supported by 0.9.0 version
  - New try: append all .conf files in repo to lircd.conf -> worked!
- exec bash .....sh instead of -c "bash .....sh" ?
  - Tried it -> worked!
