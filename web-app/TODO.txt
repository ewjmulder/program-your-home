- Add nice favicon.ico file for PYH webapp
- move to jquery rest prod (min) version
- move to handlebars prod (runtime) version
- find out if we need all mmenu css and js stuff
- Refactor out local images (refreshable ones at least) and use all images from server
  - Serve module depenent images from the main server -> individual modules should not be required to provide context images for their functionality!
- Document specifics of used JS stuff on menu / pages / rest / etc
  - mmenu: href='#' will have default behavior blocked!
  - rest: double nested resources requires ID for the first!
    So my REST service starts at /main /hue etc, which makes sense indeed, sep rest services for these URL's
    furthermore, the rest plugin really forces using the REST api, so get ready to reastify :)
	(probably fine to support both full rest and getters along the way. (or just use rest where I can use it and
	use simple wget style stuff to activate activities / press buttons etc)
