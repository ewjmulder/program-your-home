- Merge remote config files during build instead of duplicating everything
- Use Jirc to parse remote files? -> zie lib dir en http://www.harctoolbox.org/Jirc.html
- Colored keys as seperate group!
- All remote definition files should have a newline at the end, otherwise combining script will create invalid results
  - document or adapt script (provision.sh) to add a newline after each file
- Remove references to WinLIRC and make general LIRC, since we support that as well
- Make a setting for WinLIRC / LIRC, since the protocol used is slightly different
